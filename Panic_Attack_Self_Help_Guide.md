## What is a Panic Attack?

A panic attack is a sudden episode of intense fear or discomfort that peaks within minutes. It includes physical symptoms (racing heart, shortness of breath, sweating) and psychological symptoms (fear of losing control or dying). While terrifying, panic attacks are not dangerous and always pass.

## Immediate Coping Techniques

### 1. **Grounding Technique: 5-4-3-2-1 Method**
When you feel panic rising, use your senses to reconnect to the present moment:
- **5 things you see**: Name them (e.g., "ceiling, lamp, picture, book, wall")
- **4 things you can touch**: Feel textures
- **3 things you hear**: Listen to sounds around you
- **2 things you can smell**: Or imagine pleasant scents
- **1 thing you can taste**: A mint, water, or anything available

### 2. **Box Breathing (4-4-4-4)**
Regulate your nervous system with controlled breathing:
1. Inhale for 4 counts
2. Hold for 4 counts
3. Exhale for 4 counts
4. Hold for 4 counts
5. Repeat 5-10 times

This reduces hyperventilation and signals safety to your body.

### 3. **Progressive Muscle Relaxation**
1. Tense muscle groups for 5 seconds, then release
2. Start with toes, move up to calves, thighs, glutes, abdomen, chest, arms, neck, face
3. Notice the difference between tension and relaxation
4. This teaches your body how to release tension

### 4. **The Cold Water Shock (Dive Reflex)**
- Splash cold water on your face or hold ice cubes
- This activates the parasympathetic nervous system and can interrupt panic
- Alternatively, place a cold object against your cheek

### 5. **Reality Checking**
Ask yourself:
- "What are 3 facts about my current situation?"
- "Have I survived panic attacks before?" (Yes, you have)
- "What is actually threatening me right now?"
- This engages your logical brain and reduces catastrophic thinking

## Cognitive Strategies (Mind-Based)

### 1. **Identify Catastrophic Thoughts**
Panic feeds on "what-if" thinking:
- **Anxious thought**: "I'm having a heart attack"
- **Reality check**: "I've experienced this before and I'm fine. It's panic, not a heart attack."

### 2. **Acceptance vs. Resistance**
- **Don't fight panic** (fighting makes it worse)
- **Accept it**: "This is panic. It's uncomfortable but not dangerous. I can handle this."
- **Allow it to pass**: Panic peaks in 10 minutes and naturally subsides

### 3. **Positive Self-Talk**
- "This will pass"
- "I am safe, even though it doesn't feel like it"
- "My body is reacting, but I am not in danger"
- "I have survived every panic attack so far"

### 4. **Worry Time (Scheduled Worry)**
- Set aside 15 minutes daily to write down worries
- This prevents rumination throughout the day
- Often, worries feel less threatening when scheduled

## Physical Strategies (Body-Based)

### 1. **Controlled Breathing Exercises**
- **4-7-8 Breathing**: Inhale (4), hold (7), exhale (8) - emphasizes long exhales
- **Pursed-Lip Breathing**: Breathe slowly through nose, exhale through pursed lips
- Avoid hyperventilation by breathing into a paper bag if needed

### 2. **Movement & Exercise**
- Light walking, jogging, or stretching
- Yoga (especially restorative or yin yoga)
- Dancing to music
- Physical activity burns off stress hormones

### 3. **Warm Baths/Showers**
- Warm water activates the parasympathetic nervous system
- Promotes relaxation and reduces muscle tension
- 15-20 minutes is ideal

### 4. **Progressive Exposure (Desensitization)**
- Gradually face panic-inducing situations in small steps
- Start with mild discomfort, build tolerance
- Example: If panic occurs in crowds, start by visiting less crowded places

## Long-Term Prevention Strategies

### 1. **Lifestyle Changes**
- **Regular Exercise**: 30 minutes, 5 days/week reduces anxiety by 20-30%
- **Sleep**: 7-9 hours per night (poor sleep increases panic risk)
- **Reduce Caffeine**: Caffeine mimics anxiety symptoms
- **Limit Alcohol**: Alcohol can trigger panic and worsen anxiety
- **Nutrition**: Balanced diet with vitamins B and D, magnesium-rich foods

### 2. **Stress Management**
- Meditation: Even 5-10 minutes daily helps
- Mindfulness apps: Headspace, Calm, Insight Timer
- Journaling: Write about feelings and worries
- Time in nature: Walking outside reduces anxiety
- Creative hobbies: Art, music, writing

### 3. **Sleep Hygiene**
- Consistent sleep schedule (same time daily)
- Cool, dark bedroom
- No screens 30 minutes before bed
- Avoid caffeine after 2 PM
- No alcohol before bed (disrupts sleep quality)

### 4. **Social Support**
- Talk to friends and family about your experience
- Join support groups (online or in-person)
- Avoid isolation, which worsens anxiety
- Share your panic plan with trusted people

## When to Seek Professional Help

Consider professional support if:
- Panic attacks occur frequently (more than once per week)
- You're avoiding situations due to fear of panic
- Self-help strategies aren't providing relief after 4-6 weeks
- Panic is significantly impacting daily life, work, or relationships
- You have thoughts of self-harm

### Professional Treatment Options

1. **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**
   - Most effective evidence-based treatment
   - Typically 12-16 sessions
   - Teaches you to change thought patterns and behaviors

2. **Exposure Therapy**
   - Gradually face panic-triggering situations safely
   - Reduces fear response over time

3. **Medication**
   - SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors): First-line medication
   - Beta-blockers: For physical symptoms
   - Benzodiazepines: Short-term use only (risk of dependence)

4. **Combined Treatment**
   - Therapy + medication often most effective
